This project use linked list to implement polynomial

Here's the rule:
1)There's two polynomials you need to enter.
2)You need to enter how many terms in this polynomial.
3)The input should be like this(coefficient, exponential):
  ex: x^3+3x^2+3x^1+1  ----> 1 3 3 2 3 1 1 0
4)Then, enter the x for evaluating y

If I had more spare time, I would changed the main program to Menu type.
