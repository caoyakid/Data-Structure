In this project:
1 -> wall
0 -> road 
the upper left corner -> start point
the lower right corner -> end point

Use <stack> to store the path you have traversed
then use fstream to read the file and get the maze(array)

Noticed:
If you use the new maze.txt, then you should resize the #define row = ?, col = ?
in main,cpp in case that you get the wrong maze.
